The EcoEncontros is a seminar series of weekly talks at the Ecology Graduate Program at the University of São Paulo (PPGE, IB-USP). The information from all talks between 2008 and 2019 from the EcoEncontros committee attendance list archives (N=344 talks). We retrieved data about the speaker (gender, academic level , and affiliation) and the seminar (date, title, abstract, and audience). We inferred the speaker's gender by name and photo (always present on the seminars’ posters).
